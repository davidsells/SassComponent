## Sass Grid Example

This project bootstrapped my investigation of generalizing.  It was the programmatic approach to CSS that was of interest.  The exploration was into programmatic SASS to create a customizable CSS component.

## A Bubble Menu

I was flipping through various menu implementations on codepen.io and this one caught my eye.  It had elements that were at least a little interesting: animation, no-javascript and somewhat pleasing to the eye.

## CSS to SASS

The CSS code is faily standard.  I wanted to implement it in SCSS.   There are some very good tools on line to convert CSS into SCSS code.  I checked-out a few tools and this one did a very good job.  It even extracted constants which is a real bonus.
